A Coq formalisation of the R programming language

* Overview

The project is divided in several passes, each providing a more typed
version of the R programming language.
Each pass is related with the next by the corresponding *relation.v file.

** Rinternals.v
   This file describes the data structures of R as they are in its C code.

** Rtypedinternals.v
   In practise, the different language elements of R can not receive
   anything. This version presents a version of the semantics in which
   these assumptions are made explicit.

** Rhighlevel.v
   A High-level intuition of how R behaves.
