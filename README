A Coq formalisation of the R programming language

* Overview

The project is divided in several passes, each providing a more typed
version of the R programming language.
Each pass is related with the next by the corresponding *relation.v file.

** low

This folder is a low-level specification of R.
It is the closest possible to the R source code (in C).

*** Rinternals.v

This file describes the data structures of R as they are in its C code.

*** Monads.v

This file provides useful data structures to manipulate the model of the C memory.

*** Reval.v

A Coq formalisation of the evaluation functions of R in its C code.

** structured

A formalisation of R a little more structured and typed than the low-level
representation.
In particular, the C memory has been abstracted out.

*** Rinternals.v

In practise, the different language elements of R can not receive
anything. This version presents a version of the semantics in which
these assumptions are made explicit.

** high

A High-level intuition of how R behaves.

*** Rstructures.v

High-level data structures.

*** RReasoning.v

Provides tools to reason about R programs.
