(** Rcore.
  Describes how R evaluates expressions.
  The content of this file is the Coq equivalent of functions from R source code.
  Note that only relevant definitions are translated here. Some are just
  reinterpreted in Coq without following the original algorithm of the
  C source. See report for more details. **)
