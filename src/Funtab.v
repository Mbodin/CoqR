(** The [Funtab] effect in Result calls a function with the following type. **)
Definition funtab_function :=
  SEXP -> (** call **)
  SEXP -> (** op **)
  SEXP -> (** args **)
  SEXP -> (** rho **)
  mRHFJE SEXP.

(** The [FUNTAB] is then an array of such functions, with some
  additional meta-data, like the function name: **)
Record funtab_cell := make_funtab_cell {
    fun_name : string ;
    fun_cfun : funtab_function ;
    fun_code : int ; (** The number stored here can be quite large. We thus use [int] instead of [nat]. **)
    fun_eval : funtab_eval_arg ;
    fun_arity : int ;
    fun_gram : PPinfo
  }.

Instance funtab_cell_Inhab : Inhab funtab_cell.
Proof. apply Inhab_of_val. constructors; apply arbitrary. Defined.

Definition funtab := ArrayList.array funtab_cell.
