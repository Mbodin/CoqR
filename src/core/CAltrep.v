  represent some operations, to avoid allocating trivial arrays into
  the memory.  The relevant code is however under active
  developpement, and it would not make sense to start formalising it
  right now.  We thus implement the following function using the
  traditionnal representation, although it needs more memory and time
  resources. **)
